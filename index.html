							“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
							looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
							amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
							it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
							the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
							course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
							Engineer at a VR startup. ”

						<p class="testimonials__quote-text">
							“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
							needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
							programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
							of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
							curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
							never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
							particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
							way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
							during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
							helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
							offers. 100% recommend! ”
